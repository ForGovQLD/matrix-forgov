                <p>Connecting to dual monitors in a Distributed Work Centre.</p>
            
                <p>These dual monitors incorporate a docking station that automatically connects both monitors, USB ports and a built-in webcam with a single cable connection to your laptop or tablet.</p>
            
                <p>Firstly, press the button under the bottom right of each screen to power them on. You'll notice an orange or white light to indicate power. You should also power up your device before connecting any cables.</p>
            
                <p>You'll see two cables coming from the left-hand monitor. A USB-C cable, which most modern devices will have, and a USB-A cable which is suitable for older devices. Select only the appropriate cable for your device type, connect, and wait for 20 to 30 seconds for the monitors to be detected.</p>
            
                <p>There is a pop-up webcam with built-in microphone on top of the left-hand monitor. Push down on it and it will spring up. In your video conference app you may need to hit the 'switch camera' icon to activate it.</p>
            
                <p>The monitor should automatically detect which input you are using but you can use the input button â€“ second from right on the left hand monitor, to cycle between USB-C and USB display link if the monitor is not detecting your device.</p>
            
                <p>Now you're set up and ready to go.</p>
